    "I discovered my gift after 8 years. And when I did, AI shook the world. So I began asking myself — What is it that I can do that AI cannot? More importantly, I became curious about this new technology. What can it do? What it cannot? How is it going to change our world? Our lives? What will it mean to be distinctly human? These are the questions that I’m currently grappling with, and trying to find the answers to. Subscribe to The AI Odyssey to explore the answers to these questions with me."
